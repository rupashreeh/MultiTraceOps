 MultiTraceOps
Enhanced Multi Layer Observability For Fault Localization


MiTraceOps is a powerful observability library and platform designed to enable precise fault localization in cloud-native microservices-based systems. It achieves this by collecting and correlating logs and metrics across multiple layers of the system, including the application layer and the database layer. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively use MiTraceOps to monitor microservices, detect incidents, and pinpoint faults with high accuracy.
