# Developer Documentation : MultiTraceOps
Enhanced Multi Layer Observability For Fault Localization


MiTraceOps is a powerful observability library and platform designed to enable precise fault localization in cloud-native microservices-based systems. It achieves this by collecting and correlating logs and metrics across multiple layers of the system, including the application layer and the database layer. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively use MiTraceOps to monitor microservices, detect incidents, and pinpoint faults with high accuracy.

2. Getting Started:
To integrate MiTraceOps into your microservices-based system, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Install MiTraceOps library in your application.
- Step 2: Configure MiTraceOps to collect logs and metrics from various layers.
- Step 3: Implement the common request identifier tagging for correlation.
- Step 4: Set up the observability platform to generate alerts and analyze data.
