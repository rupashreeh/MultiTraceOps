Kafka Binaries Not Found:

If you encounter an error like /usr/local/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh: no such file or directory, it indicates that the script couldn't find the Kafka binaries.
Double-check the path to your Kafka binaries in the kafka_setup.sh script. Ensure that it matches the actual location of Kafka on your system.
Kafka Not Starting:

If you experience issues with Kafka not starting, verify that you have followed the installation steps correctly and that Zookeeper and Kafka services are running.
Check the status of Zookeeper and Kafka services using systemctl status zookeeper and systemctl status kafka commands.
If there are any errors in the logs, investigate and resolve them accordingly.
Kafka Topic Creation Fails:

If there are problems creating Kafka topics during the setup, make sure that Kafka is up and running.
Check the Kafka logs for any error messages that might indicate the cause of the topic creation failure.
Ensure that the Kafka binaries path in the kafka_setup.sh script is correctly set to the location of the Kafka binaries on your system.
