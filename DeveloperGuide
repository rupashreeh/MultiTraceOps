# Setup Instructions
To set up the development environment for the Exemplar Service, follow these steps:

#Ensure you have Java 17 installed on your system. You can check the Java version by running the following command in the terminal:

java -version
If Java 17 is not installed, download and install it from the official website or package manager for your operating system.

# Verify that you have Maven 3.8.6 installed on your system by running the following command in the terminal:

mvn --version
If Maven 3.8.6 is not installed, download and install it from the official Maven website.

# Install MySQL on your system. If it's not already installed, you can do so by running the following command in the terminal:

sql

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server

#Download and install Zookeeper and Kafka. If you are using Ubuntu, follow these steps:

Run sudo apt install zookeeper to install Zookeeper.

Download Kafka from the Apache Kafka website using the following command:
wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.3.1/kafka_2.12-3.3.1.tgz

Extract Kafka and move it to the installation directory:
tar xzf kafka_2.12-3.3.1.tgz
sudo mv kafka_2.12-3.3.1 /usr/local/kafka

Move the zookeeper.service and kafka.service files to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

Run the following commands to start Zookeeper and Kafka services:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
